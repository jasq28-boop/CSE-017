1.First we would open one of the files
2.Then we would have a method that creates a new class for each new ProductID that is read
  This method would take in the ProductID and calculate the revenue based on the quantity and price per until
3. A running total of each type of Product ID will be kept
4. We will have an ArrayList of all the unique ProductIDs, and before creating a new object, we will check if that ProductID already
exist
5. We will implement a try-catch-finally block to open the files from the North, South, and West one at a time
6. Once the file is open, we will close it once hasNext() is false
7. If one of the lines isn't the correct format or doesn't have any information, it will throw an exception, and skip and continue until there is no more lines
to read in the file. The finally block will close the file.
